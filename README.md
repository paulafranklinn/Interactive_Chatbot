# Interactive Chatbot with Groq

This project implements an interactive chatbot using the Groq API and the Llama 3.1 model. The chatbot allows users to ask questions and receive answers in real time.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

### Python Packages

- `dotenv`
- `langchain_groq`

### Obtaining the Groq API Key

To use the API, you will need a Groq API key. Follow the steps below to obtain one:

1. **Sign Up and Log In**:  
   - Visit the [Groq Cloud Console](https://console.groq.com/playground) and create your account. After registering, log in.

2. **Navigate to the API Keys Section**:  
   - Once logged into the console, go to the **"API Keys"** section where you can generate new keys.

3. **Creating the API Key**:  
   - Click on **"Create API Key"** and give your key a descriptive name.  
   - **Important**: This key is displayed only once, so save it in a secure location, as you won't be able to see it again.

## Installation

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv langchain-groq
